# Premier League Transfer Analysis (1992/93 - 2022/23)

## Introduction
Welcome to the "Premier League Transfer Analysis" repository! This project delves into the fascinating world of football transfers within the Premier League, the top tier of English football and one of the most celebrated sports leagues globally. Known for its high financial power and competitive nature, the Premier League's transfer market activities offer a rich dataset for analysis. Our Jupyter Notebook investigates transfer data from the 1992/93 season to the 2022/23 season, sourced from [Transfermarkt](https://github.com/ewenme/transfers/blob/master/data/premier-league.csv).

## Objectives
The analysis aims to uncover trends and patterns in player transfers, focusing on:
- Number of players transferred per club.
- Total spend by current Premier League teams.
- Expenditure on players across different positions.
- Net spend history of the teams, especially those in the top 8.

## Repository Structure
